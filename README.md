# Advanced-line-follower
A line follower that that works on complex paths using sound sensor and colour sensor based on Arduino.
This project wa part of an robotic contest,where your bot has to traverse the complex track,cross the finishing line in the least possible time possible
Our bot was good enough to secure 3rd position in the event.
The priority order of traversal was-->path traversal-->check for colour at the junctions/cross shaped path-->check for sound direction-->counting on these condition move ahead to traverse the desired path.
This prototype can be modified to be used in industries for complex path traversal purposes and hence reduce human labour.
